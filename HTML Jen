  <p> The GIF on the left is made up of lots of pictures of myself, with one of 
  me overlaying it. The GIF on the right is in the similar sort of style, except
  it is made up of lots of images of my work.</p>

  <h4>Self Portrait</h4>

  <p>Charles Thomas Close is an American painter, artist, and photographer. 
  He achieved fame as a photorealist. Close paints abstract portraits, and self,
  whilst also creating photo portraits using a very large format camera.</p>

  <p>“Close’s dependence on the grid as a metaphor for his analytical processes, 
  which suggest that the “whole” is rarely more (or less) than the sum of its parts, 
  is a conceptual equivalent for the camera’s analytical, serial approach to any given subject.
    Every street-smart, colorful Polaroid is as much a time-based and fragmentary 
    gesture as any more laborious stroke of the painter’s brush in the cloistered studio.” 
    (“Chuck Close Biography, Art, And Analysis Of Works”)</p>

  <p>Throughout all of Close’s work, he uses the same grid style. This makes his work very 
  unique to him, and makes it easy to recognise his work.</p>

  <p>Whilst looking at his work, I got the idea to create a GIF in the similar style. 
  For example, using a grid of my work and overlaying my face onto it.</p>

  <p>What I like about these GIF’s, is the simpleness and lack of colour. 
  Sticking to just black and white takes away any distractions, and allows you 
  to focus purely on the movement within the GIF itself. The added touch of the 
  red lips is interesting. It highlights one particular part of the body.</p>

  <h2 class="subtitles">GIF CREATIONS!</h2>
  
  <h3 class="category">GIF, Photography</h3>
  
  <p>This project is asking me to showcase myself in the form of a GIF.
  So I questioned how I could do this, and my first idea, although simple and obvious,
  was to show myself as a photographer.</p>

  <h3 class="category">GIF, Photography</h3>
  
  <p>Cinemagraphs are still photographs in which a minor movement occurs. 
  They are published as an animated GIF. They are made by taking a series of 
  photographs or a video recording, and, using image editing software, compositing
  the photographs or the video frames into a seamless loop of sequential frames.</p>

  <h3 class="DarkGrayChunky">Next Project:</h3>
  
  <p>You will research and explore the ways in which creative practitioners
  create self-portraits that reflect their identity to the world. Supported by 
  three workshops with tech and tutor input, you will originate, develop and produce
  your own final animated GIF self-portrait – literally putting yourself in the picture. 
  Create your final self-portrait from scratch, or base your animated ‘selfie’ on an existing
  portrait by another creative practitioner as an imaginative ‘reconstruction’ or ‘replica’ 
  moving image artwork.</p>

  <h2 class="subtitles">‘EXPOSED’ JANUARY – FEBRUARY 2017</h2>
  
  <h3 class="category">Exhibitions, Photography</h3>
  
  <!-- Enter Jenn's photos here -->
  
  <p>At the end of a University module called ‘Independent Practise’, 
  a selected amount of students work was exhibited in the Scott Building,
  Plymouth University.</p>
  
  <p>For my piece, I wanted to focus on Body Image. The media portrays this idea 
  of the ‘perfect body’ and that this is how everyone should aspire to look. Yet, 
  it also contradicts itself with the notion that we should be comfortable in our own 
  skin; we should be happy with the way we look and not be envious, or care what others 
  think. In my series of photographs, ‘Exposed’, I explored these issues. This is the first
  piece of work I have created in a Studio setting. </p>

  <!-- Picture goes here -->
  
  <p>As part of a collaborative University module in 2015, we were required to 
  develop our own curatorial theme, and collectively curate and install an exhibition.
  Our theme and title of the exhibition was ‘Out with the new, in with the used’. 
  The exhibition was held in a public space, at Comma 5,  in Plymouth.</p>

  <h2 class="subtitles">MY STYLE OF PHOTOGRAPHY</h2>
  
  <h3 class="category">Blog, Children, Landscape, Nature, Photography</h3>
  
  <!-- Photo goes here -->
  
  <p>First blog post problems… What to write about?</p>
  
  <p>So, I thought I’d write a post explaining a bit more about my style of
  photography and what I enjoy photographing!</p>
  
  <p>As you can see from my portfolio, I like taking photographs of both landscapes, 
  and portraits. I am not one for staging my shoots, or for working in a studio. 
  I would much rather be outside, capturing natural shots, and working with the environment 
  I am given. My nieces have been the biggest inspiration for these kinds of shots. 
  Whilst photographing children, you have very little control. I have some absolutely 
  cracking photographs, (ones which they will hate me for later on in life) of them growing 
  up that I wouldn’t of captured if I had put them in a studio environment. 
  Documenting their childhood has been a fun, joyful, and ongoing project!
  However, moving away for University has meant my main little subjects don’t 
  appear so often in my work anymore!</p>
